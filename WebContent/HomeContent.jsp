<h1>Shuttle U Home</h1>
<p> Shuttle-U-Home provides free transportation from campus for Syracuse University students, faculty, 
and staff who reside off campus within a designated geographic area. 
The shuttle runs daily from 8:15 p.m. to 3:30 a.m. during the academic year.<b>Please note that the shuttle will take you to YOUR residence, and no place else.</b>
<p>The Shuttle-U-Home program operates on a first-come, first-serve basis; you cannot reserve a spot on the shuttle. The shuttle holds seven passengers, and the length of the trip depends on the number of passengers and their destinations, as the shuttle does not operate on a fixed route.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the shuttle can be delayed due to weather and/or traffic conditions.</p>
<p>Other reminders about the Shuttle-U-Home service:</p>
<ul>
<li>If weather causes poor road conditions, the shuttle may be cancelled at any time during the hours of operation, due to safety issues.</li>
<li>The shuttle is unable to transport infants or toddlers due to lack of safety equipment.</li>
<li>The shuttle is unable to transport bicycles.</li>
<li>The shuttle does not leave immediately upon your arrival. The shuttle will leave 10-15 minutes after the first person registers for the trip.</li>
<li>The shuttle is not a taxi service. Please help the driver of the shuttle with the location of your residence.</li>
</ul>
